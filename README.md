# Object-Oriented-JavaScript

Programming (OOP):
•	 Object, method, and property
•	 Class
•	 Encapsulation
•	 Aggregation
•	 Reusability/inheritance
•	 Polymorphism

Object:

  An object is a representation of a "thing" (someone or something), and this representation is
expressed with the help of a programming language.

ex:
•	 Objects are most often named using nouns (book, person, and so on)
•	 Methods are verbs (read, run, and so on)
•	 Values of the properties are adjectives
